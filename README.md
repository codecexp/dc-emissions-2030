# dc-emissions-2030

A repository for projecting Global, US, and per-state emissions at 2030.

## Data

### Data Center Electricity Demand Data

### Carbon Intensity Data

Carbon Intensity data is obtained from [Electricity Maps](https://portal.electricitymaps.com/datasets) and [Ember](https://ember-energy.org/data/yearly-electricity-data/). The relevant files are in the ```data/carbon-intensity/``` folder.

File naming convention: \<source\>-\<region\>-\<granularity\>-CI.xlsx. For example, EMaps-EU-annual-CI.xlsx.

Each file has a Metadata sheet explaining the contents of the file.

## Emission Analysis

The code will be uploaded soon.
